# Basey

Basey is a developer-friendly WordPress base (or parent) theme built with [UIkit](https://github.com/uikit/uikit) and [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com).

Extremely flexible, easy to customize and adheres to WordPress coding standards for a friendlier theming experience.

## Customization: Getting Started

* Make sure you have the following installed:
    * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
    * [Bower](http://bower.io)
    * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
* In your terminal, navigate to your site's directory and run the following:
    * `bower install`
    	* Installs necessary frontend assets
    * `npm install`
    	* Installs Gulp and Gulp plugins for compiling assets
    * `gulp`
   		* Builds initial styles
    * `gulp watch`
    	* Watches the theme folder for changes

Enjoy!
